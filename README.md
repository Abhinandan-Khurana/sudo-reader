# Unclutter â€” Modern Reader Mode

Unclutter is a modern reader mode and article library for your browser.

Well, I have added a few twists compare to the original Unclutter

Medium now have paywall, so called "member-only story", which make me annoyed. So I create this as a workaround for the mentioned problem.

## Why does it exist?

There many other "reader modes", but they all extract article text and re-render it their own format. Unclutter "unclutters" the original web pages itself, leaving their [visual style](docs/comparison.md) and interactive elements intact.

Articles you read with Unclutter are automatically saved and can be easily added to your read-it-later queue.
Everything happens instantly in your browser.

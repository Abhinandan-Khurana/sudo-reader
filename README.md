# Un-Medium â€” Modern Reader Mode

Un-Medium is a modern reader mode and article library for your browser, with a few twists!

Thank you [Unclutter](https://github.com/lindylearn/unclutter) for the code base of a great reader

## Why does it exist?

There many other "reader modes", but they all extract article text and re-render it their own format. Unclutter "unclutters" the original web pages itself, leaving their [visual style](docs/comparison.md) and interactive elements intact.

Articles you read with Unclutter are automatically saved and can be easily added to your read-it-later queue.
Everything happens instantly in your browser.

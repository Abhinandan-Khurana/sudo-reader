Alternative client for Hypothes.is web annotations.

• One click for everything: simply selecting text creates a highlight, editing a note updates it, there's a switch to make annotations public or private.
• More annotations: Find inline quote comments from Hacker News, and a graph of the article's popularity over time.
• The annotation sidebar stays open, so you always see your in-progress notes.

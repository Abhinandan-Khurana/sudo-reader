-- annotation focused

Alternative client for Hypothes.is web annotations.

• One click for everything: simply selecting text creates a highlight, editing a note updates it, there's a switch to make annotations public or private.
• More annotations: Find inline quote comments from Hacker News, and a graph of the article's popularity over time.
• The annotation sidebar stays open, so you always see your in-progress notes.

-- reader focused

This extension hides everything you didn't visit a page for: attention-grabbing promotions, sidebars, or cookie banners. 

But in comparison to all other "reader modes", websites keep their original style, identity, and functionality.

The internet should be about exploration, not consuming more and more content in the same sans-serif font.
Would you read all your books in the same sans-serif font?

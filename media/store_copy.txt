-- annotation focused

Alternative client for Hypothes.is web annotations.

• One click for everything: simply selecting text creates a highlight, editing a note updates it, there's a switch to make annotations public or private.
• More annotations: Find inline quote comments from Hacker News, and a graph of the article's popularity over time.
• The annotation sidebar stays open, so you always see your in-progress notes.

-- reader focused

This extension hides everything you didn't visit a page for: attention-grabbing promotions, sidebars, or cookie banners. 

But in comparison to all other "reader modes", websites keep their original style, identity, and functionality.

-- Privacy practices:

Improve the readability of articles the user visits by simplifying a website's CSS.
If the user so chooses, change the HTML of the active page to display the extension functionality.


Allow the creation and display of web annotations on article pages the user visits.
Storing user settings and authentication tokens.
If the user so chooses, change the HTML of the active page to display web annotations about that page.


Required to inject a "bootloader" content script into every webpage the user visits. This small script checks if the extension was configured by the user to activate on a given website.
If the extension was configured to activate, the bootloader script performs a few cosmetic HTML changes and requests the injection of another larger content script from the background service worker. If the extension was not configured for a given website, the bootloader script does nothing. 
The activation check runs inside a content script instead of the background service worker to perform HTML modifications faster (if so configured). This improves the user experience.

"gives you back control over how you read content on the web"
The internet should be about exploration, not consuming more and more content in the same sans-serif font.
Would you read all your books in the same sans-serif font?

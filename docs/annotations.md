# Private Notes

With Unclutter you can easily save highlights and create notes by selecting any article text:

To enable the feature, click on the "pen" icon in the top right of the article view. All of your notes are saved in the local browser storage and appear every time you open an article.

## Hypothes.is sync

You can configure your highlights and notes to be synchronized with [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is)
in order to access them on different devices, organize, or import them into note-taking apps.

You can then also make any of your notes publicly visible to other Unclutter and Hypothes.is users by clicking the "globe" icon on each note. Other users can then reply to your idea just like you can then reply to theirs.

To configure this sync:

1. Create a free [Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/signup?utm_source=lindylearn.io) if you don't already have one.
2. Generate your [API token](https://hypothes.is/account/developer) and enter it in the Unclutter extensions settings.
3. From now on, notes will be stored on Hypothes.is rather than in your browser storage. All existing local annotations will be uploaded automatically.

You can then browse and search across your notes / annotations on your [hypothes.is profile](https://hypothes.is/users/peterhagen), or using [Lindy Annotations](http://annotations.lindylearn.io/) (this only works for public annotations). To configure imports to Obsidian, Roam, or other note-taking apps, see [these plugins](https://web.hypothes.is/tools-plug-ins-and-integrations/#:~:text=For%20note%2Dtaking%20apps).

# Annotations Sync

Unclutter supports highlighting and annotating articles, so you can read more deeply and remember the things you read in a lightweight way.

By default, all your annotations are saved in your browser storage and not accessible to anyone else. But you can also synchronize your annotations with a private [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) account, which has the following benefits:

-   Annotate articles in different places, yet see your notes everywhere. For example, use the [official Hypothesis browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek) to annotate PDFs, Unclutter to annotate long reads, and the [via.hypothes.is](https://via.hypothes.is) website to create notes from your mobile phone.
-   Organize and search across your annotations on your [hypothes.is profile](https://hypothes.is/users/peterhagen) or using [Lindy Annotations](http://annotations.lindylearn.io/).
-   Import annotations into note-taking tools like Roam, Obisidian, Notion, etc.
-   You can set some of your annotations to public to spark a conversation with others, and can reply to other's annotations.

Hypothes.is is a non-profit company not related to LindyLearn. I just think they're cool and perfect to synchronize annotations across different places.

## Setup

1. [Create a free Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/signup?utm_source=lindylearn.io) if you don't already have one.
2. [Generate your API token](https://hypothes.is/account/developer) and enter it in the Unclutter extensions settings.
3. From now on, annotations will be stored using Hypothes.is rather than your browser storage. All existing local annotations will be uploaded automatically.
4. That's it!

endless article scoll issue

- delete (not hide) .caas-readmore
massive amount of hiding overall

- allow quirky pages like this (unique header, background, font colors etc)
but text could be a bit smaller?


ideas
- need css changes, just blocking doesn't always work
- find readability text and delete every other node?
- now to worka round paywalls?
- easy block editor - crowdsourcing
- remove static elements?
- make it work for top pages (global, from HN, ...). test infra?
- author, date, share buttons standardized and blocked in article?
- centering
- **automatically enabled** on article pages
    via reading time detection?
    per-site inclusion or exclusion

    
 for article sites (or disabled?) (automatically from news aggregators?)
    or 



advantage over reading mode
- standardized yet with character
- keep interactive graphs
- like economist.com articles, but everywhere

or "parse to substack?"
- background color, font, etc. but same template

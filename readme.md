## Installation

Install the extension for Chrome or Firefox. Then simply click the ðŸ“’ icon in the extensions bar to see and create annotations. They're synchronized with Hypothes.is

## Features

-   One click to do everything: selecting text creates a highlight, adding or editing a note updates the annotation automatically, one switch to make annotations public.
-   The annotations sidebar stays open, so you see all your in-progress notes while reading.
-   Shows Hacker News comments inline

## License

This project is a simplified rewrite of the official Hypothes.is browser extension. It uses a few code pieces of it, particularly the "annotator" component to anchor text on webpages. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/hypothesis/client/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.
